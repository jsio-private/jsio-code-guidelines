# Getting Started with Markdown

## Snippets and Style Guide

### Headings

You can create HTML elements &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; easily by prepending the text you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (#).

```markdown
# This is an <h1>
## This is an <h2>
### This is an <h3>
#### This is an <h4>
##### This is an <h5>
###### This is an <h6>
```

### Text styles

Text can be easily styled as italic or bold using markdown.

```markdown
*This text is in italics.*
_And so is this text._

**This text is in bold.**
__And so is this text.__

***This text is in both.***
**_As is this!_**
*__And this!__*
```

### Code blocks

You can use a special syntax for code

```ruby
def foobar
    puts "Hello world!"
end
```

### Links

One of the best things about markdown is how easy it is to make links. Put the text to display in square brackets [] followed by the url in parentheses ()

```markdown
[Click me](https://google.com/)
```

### Images

Images are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front!

```markdown
![This is the alt-attribute for my image](http://imgur.com/myimage.jpg)
```
