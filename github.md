## Github Project Boards

Each project should have the following columns:

| Column | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| TODO | To be done |
| In Progress | Someone is currently working on |
| Review | Has been finished, but still needs to be reviewed |
| Done | Has gone through review |
| Later Date | Out of scope for this deadline, still should have in project eventually |


### Procedure

- Pick something from `TODO` to work on, move it to `In Progress`, and add your first initial to the start of the note
- When done, commit, and move to `Review`
- To review a card:
  - Make sure that it works without doubt in game
  - Move to done regardless of success
  - If unsuccessful, add a new card to `TODO`, detailing what further changes are needed, and make note of the parent card: "(parent card-745821)"
